Hello, these are my personal notes and knowledge graph. I started using Obsidian
a bit early in 2020. and continued graphing my knowledge from there.

I wanted something more towards functional, as to offer me a practical snippet
library for my TTP's, both online and as a backup of dementia.

The notes are largery inspired by others and especial [Andy's](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) note-taking samples on his site. Thanks to Justin and Jethro for their theme support on static generation for this library of mine. Hope it will be worth to you as well as me.

You can start exploring from the [List of Topics](/list-of-topics), [List of Tools](/list-of-tools), or see the [full list of notes](/notes/posts).
