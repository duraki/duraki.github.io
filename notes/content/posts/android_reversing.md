### Burp Proxy Setup

If using **Android 7** or above, you need to export Burp CA Certificate from `Proxy â†’ Options`, and selecting `Import/Export CA certificate`. Android wants the certificate to be in **PEM format**. The filename has to be equal to the `subject_hash_old` value appended with `.0`.

**Note** - if you are using OpenSSL < 1.0, you need to use `subject_hash` instead of `subject_hash_old`. 

Using `openssl` is recommended way to convert DER to PEM format. Dump the `subject_hash_old` and rename the file as explained above.

```
$ openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out cacert.pem
$ openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in cacert.pem |head -1
$ mv cacert.pem <hash>.0
```

Push the certificate onto Android device by using `adb` or `ssh`:

```
# => move cert to the device
$ adb push <hash>.0 /data/local/tmp

# => on android device:
$ adb shell
% su
% mount -o rw,remount /system 
% mv /data/local/tmp/<hash>.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/
% chown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/<hash>.0
% chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/<hash>.0
% reboot
```
