title: "Vehicle Graybox Security Testing"
---

## Security Testing Methods
- Brute-force [CAN](./canfd-specifications) fuzzer for fuzzing application software
- Interface scanner, layered fuzzing
- DoS, Replay Messages, Tampering
- Man in the Middle
- Read and write into flash dump (extract keys, certificates, sensitive data)

## Security Testing in Practice
- Send out particular frame IDs using IG Generator
- Mount network-based attacks like DoS, MiTM, Tampering of Signals
- Access to debug ports like JTAG to extract + corrupt flash memory/firmware
- Flash dump - Look into sensitive data

### Approach
- Reconnaissance
- Start with market requirements
- Use customer-provided documents of the system, brochures, user manuals, published material and attacks and vulnerabilities of used components

### Understand the Architecture
- Analyze high-level architecture and interfaces to understand interaction between different components
- Use architecture model, system context, interface model, attack pathway, sequence diagram

### Identify valued and protectable assets
- Identify relevant assets, such is hardware, software, database, etc.
- Parse every requirement (requirement description) for a specific asset
		- Splut it into SFOP scheme (Safety, Finance, Operational Performance, Privacy)
		
### Generate Penetration Test Cases
- Do X and Y on CAN
- Do Z and W on LIN

### Perform risk-based greybox PT
- Re-create attack scenarios on devices to identify potential vulns
- Injecting,tampering 

	- Software checks:
		* Invalid address
		* Modified SW
		* Odd address
		* Invalid signature
		* Invalid seed-key
		* Downgrade software
		* Secure boot?



## Ques?

- Can we read the key, flash?
- Can we modify the flash or CAN messages?
- Can we perform a DoS and make the service unavailable
- Whats the goal of the attacker? What can he misuse and abuse
