An explorable Star Wars knowledge graph!

This is an example site of the [Little Ocean](https://github.com/justindsmith/little-ocean) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It is forked from [Jethro Kuan's Cortex theme](https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex), with a number of enhancements to more closely mimic [Andy Matuschak's notes site](https://notes.andymatuschak.org).

The Star Wars content for the knowledge graph is taken from the [Wookieepedia Wiki](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/).

You can start exploring from the [List of Characters](/list-of-characters), [List of Movies](/list-of-movies), or see the [full list of notes](/posts).

## Local Options

If you're running this site locally, you can configure the look-and-feel from the `[params.styles`] section of the `config.toml`. Uncomment all the styles to see a basic dark theme version of the site.
