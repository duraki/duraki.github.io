Secure your web app and find vulnerabilities that other companies often miss. Beat cybercriminals at their own game with our manual penetration testing scope, based on OWASP methodologies. We do not use scanners, DAST/SAST or similar appliances to conduct the test; the engagement is executed in a manual and semi-automated approach. We offer classical black-box penetration tests (zero-knowledge) as well as white-box tests and code audits. Using backend languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Python, or even C++ and Delphi? Don't worry - we cover it all.

We have performed several hundreds of penetration tests against all kinds of web applications, APIs, Infrastructure and all other online services that may poses a risk while being online.
