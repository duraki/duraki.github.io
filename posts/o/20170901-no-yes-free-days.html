<p>Well, here I am, in a mall, drinking a coffee and a Schweppes, which means I&#39;m alive, thankfully. It&#39;s a great day today, a paycheck, great weather, friday. Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m writing a blog post?!</p>
<p>I&#39;m in a great mood. Life is going better after outlawing every obstacle I&#39;ve found. Sometimes, these obstacles made me numb, but other thing, for that matter, increases rage in me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m working, as hard as I can, to bring my future self some happines. Is it worth it, I&#39;m asked sometimes. It depends. Do you want to live or survive?</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to do both, which highly increases my stress. Am I doing everything for cash? Not a chance. I&#39;ve had a black amount of bucks back then, so I experienced what I wanted, now it&#39;s time to return myself.</p>
<h2 id="holidays"><a class="header-link" href="#holidays"></a>Holidays</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve spent ten-day in Jan/Feb of 2017, while traveling and exploring Switzerland. I&#39;ve visited Munich in Germany, stayed couple of days in French part of Swiss, like La-Faux de Fon, spent time in a German part of Swiss, like Basel, Bern, Zurich and Schafhausen, plus a few more days enjoying country-side.</p>
<p>This holiday, I&#39;m planning a trip to some Scandinavian country, like Netherland for example. I&#39;ll be damned if the money I&#39;ve spent on traveling did not make me happier at least ten times. It really did.</p>
<p>10 days available, and at least two of them will be spent in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Another two will be used to figure out where will I leave for. Rest of the days enjoying the world, whichever place I choose.</p>
<h2 id="what-then"><a class="header-link" href="#what-then"></a>What then</h2>
<p>Indeed, holidays does not last forever, but I love it that way. Cause you are there working 40+ hours a week, then suddnedly, the joy of peaceful mind. No tasks, no issues, no support tickets, no side-projects (okay, a bit of that one, I guess), no cellphone ringing. It&#39;s just me &amp; wonderfull free days to spend on whatever I want. Missed that, so here they are.</p>
<p>Should I worry about the future? Yes, quite some. I have a few courts waiting for me which is fucked up, I know, but <strong>who’m I kidding? I’m a thug ‘til I die; I’m a rider</strong>, mane.</p>
<p>But I won&#39;t. </p>
<p>Once I come back, I&#39;ll continue working on infrastructural design and microservice architecture for the company. The joy of working greatly increased with a new epic task around our project. </p>
<p>So yes, I&#39;m looking forward to come back to work. But until then ...</p>
<h2 id="outro"><a class="header-link" href="#outro"></a>Outro</h2>
<p>Also, happy Eid. These who know me are sure I&#39;m not celebrating anything, ever. Except my successes. But, happy eid to all muslims around the globe, celebrating this beautiful day.</p>
<p>Good luck to you too, be strong, be passionate and love the days, cause you aren&#39;t living forever.</p>
