      <hr style="display: block; text-align: left: width: 100%;" /><p>Some of you will understand this, once you hear family, friends, coworkers, or 
even your dog calling you by the name of <code>hacker</code>, you start to believe them.
Kind of funny tho, since once you get to that level you&#39;d rather prefer not.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t you learn everyday? And when you check out the scene, the tiny
fraction of knowledge you have is nothing compared to what is out there.
Therefore, you don&#39;t expect to ever become one.</p>
<p>Or so do you think. Contributing your time &quot;to the stuff&quot; is already a way. 
You may not be a best hacker, but you still are one. A small kind, respected in 
your own way.</p>
<p>That is, if you are not already 2skiddy.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll force myself to write a couple of <code>What I&#39;m working on</code>, which might seems
interesting in the sense of my contribution. </p>
<h1 id="nettis-(open-source)"><a class="header-link" href="#nettis-(open-source)"></a>Nettis (Open-source)</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/duraki/nettis">GitHub repo</a></p>
<p>This is something I wanted to have all my life. Basically, it&#39;s a copy of <code>Shodan</code>, a
famous tool for pentesters. Why another clone? <strong>Good question!</strong> It is
built for country of Bosnia and Herzegovina which I reference to quite some of
my tools. And it will be built on top of Shodan itself!</p>
<p>This is the first sketch of <code>nettis</code>.</p>
<p>PLACEIMGHERE</p>
<p>I know, image does not show much. At the upper layer, there is top-level domain
builder. It should support a queue-like environment to scan and map domains from
all possible sources. Once a domain is found, it does a deep scan to get
possible domains within the same root. As such, using reverse techniques, or
routes, various different fingering (ehm ...) methods to do the scan are
possible.</p>
<p>Important domains (as in - business domains, not real one), is reverse
engineering to lowest lever. A zonefile is missing for this ccTLD, so we need
to gather info from various different sources.</p>
<p>At the <strong>bottom layer</strong>, there is a split map, one for server machines (read dc, 
hosts, isp), and other for local pcs (users, human beings).</p>
<p>In the middle, there is a storage, zero-cost, all goes on gist+github. Once we
stash everything, a queue will have zeroep, it should do something all the time.</p>
<p>Controling the bot with Telegram or similar is great, especially if the bot is
running 24/7 on Pi cluster.</p>
<p>At the end, I&#39;m supposed to have information about 130k+ domain owners
(clients?), (thats nice), plus a whole network in the country mapped to ground. 
All info is already publicly available, the bot will just deep scan to connect these dots.</p>
<p>Checkout the project on <a href="https://github.com/duraki/nettis">GitHub</a>, I&#39;m studying 
Crystal with it.</p>
<h1 id="jeep---metasploit-for-your-car"><a class="header-link" href="#jeep---metasploit-for-your-car"></a>Jeep - Metasploit for your car</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/duraki/jeep">GitHub repo</a></p>
<p><code>jeep</code> is a Metasploit-like framework for CAN interfaces, mostly used in vehicle 
and automobile systems. This tool should allow you to interact with your tty 
in a simple manner, implementing both plugin system and native environment. There 
is also an API header file available for reuse and faster module writings.</p>
<p>That is how I explain this tool in few words. It&#39;s especially nice since it&#39;s
open-source, so you can learn a bit of CAN. </p>
<p><code>jeep</code> will be featured on <a href="https://can-newsletter.org/">CAN Newsletter</a> very
soon where you will get the basic details of what it actually is. For more, read
my introduction to vehicle hacking and follow the
<a href="https://github.com/duraki/jeep">repository</a>.</p>
